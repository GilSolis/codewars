<h1>Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

    Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
    
    You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
    
    If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
    
    All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.</h1>

   <script>
       function high(x){
  let alphabet = '0abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
  const score = word => word.split('').reduce((acc, current) => acc + alphabet.indexOf(current), 0)

  let highestScore = 0
  let highestScoringWord = ''

  x.split(' ').forEach(word => {
    if (highestScore < score(word)){
        highestScore = score(word)
        highestScoringWord = word
      }
    })
  return highestScoringWord
}
