    <p>In this example you need to implement a function that sort a list of integers based on it's binary representation.</p>

    <P>The rules are simple:</P>

        <li>sort the list based on the amount of 1's in the binary representation of each number.</li>
        <li>if two numbers have the same amount of 1's, the shorter string goes first. (ex: "11" goes before "101" when sorting 3 and 5 respectively)</li>
        <li>if the strings have the same length, lower decimal number goes first. (ex: 21 = "10101" and 25 = "11001", then 21 goes first as is lower)</li>
     
        <p>Examples:</p>

        <section>Input: [1,15,5,7,3]

            ( in binary strings is: ["1", "1111", "101", "111", "11"])</section>
            <br>
        <section>
         Output: [15, 7, 3, 5, 1]
            
            (and after sortByBinaryOnes is: ["1111", "111", "11", "101", "1"])
